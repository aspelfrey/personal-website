I am a former professor of mathematics looking to transition from academia to industry. 
I am skilled in developing research questions, collecting and analyzing data, producing insights based on data analysis, and data visualization. As an instructor, I have refined my ability to communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences and have excelled in course development and classroom management. I am experienced in running workshops, coordinating teams, conflict resolution, and developing documentation and reports.  I am open to new opportunities (remote or based in the Denver area) that allow me to continue to learn and bring my expertise to a collaborative team.
